# virtual_pug

##  Description ##
My Virtual Pug is a simple, text-based RPG about owning a pug.
It's written in python 3 and currently has no GUI (although there are plans to implement one some day)

To play, just start up the python file using `python3 virtual_pug.py`. You make menu selections by typing in integers or strings from the menus.
Feed your dog too much? It'll throw up and loose health. Give your dog water and don't walk it? It'll pee the floor.
It's a fairly simple game.

## Future Updates ##
1. I would like to re-encorporate an enemy encounter system. There was an older version, but it was really buggy.
2. Looting system and rewards. There are simple rewards that you can get on walks, but there is no inventory system to manage what you find.
3. GUI? Maybe?
